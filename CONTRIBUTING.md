# Contributing Guide

`aeon` is a community-driven project and contributions are most welcome. We value
all kinds of contributions, not just code. Improvements to docs, bug reports, and
taking on communications or code of conduct responsibilities are all examples of
valuable contributions beyond code which help make aeon a great package.

You can find our full contributing guide on our [website](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/contributing.html).
