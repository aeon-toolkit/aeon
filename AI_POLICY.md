# AI usage policy

`aeon` accepts the use of AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude) as part of the
development process for many users. However, `aeon` may reject PRs where AI is used as
a substitute for authorship, understanding, or testing.

General guidelines:
- The submitter is the responsible author for every line of code and every claim in
a PR.
- Do not submit AI-generated PRs, or AI-assisted code you do not personally understand
and have not tested. You should explain the changes you have made in the PR
description.
- Familiarise yourself with the surrounding codebase and contributor guidelines before
using AI tools; without that context, AI outputs often miss repository conventions,
existing utilities, and testing expectations.
- If any substantial part of the PR (e.g. code, tests, documentation, PR text) is
AI-generated, this **must** be disclosed.
- Maintainer time is limited. If we suspect these guidelines are not being followed,
we may close the PR without review.
- If you must use AI tools for communication, keep it clear and concise. Avoid filler
text and generic descriptions of what is obvious from the diff.
