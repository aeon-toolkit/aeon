# Governance

You can find our full governance guidelines on our [website](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/governance.html).

`aeon` welcomes all contributors, and anyone can involve themselves in the community
and contribute code, documentation, and ideas. The project is maintained by a group
of core developers, who are responsible for reviewing and merging contributions,
engaging with the community, and steering the project. Tasks are delegated to
workgroups, which are groups of core developers and contributors assigned by
core developers to fulfil a specific role.

aeon's decision-making process is transparent and consensus-based.
Most decisions involve seeking consensus among contributors and core developers.
If consensus is not reached, a vote can be called, requiring a two-thirds majority
of core developers for approval. The process emphasises transparency and open
discussion, with some sensitive topics discussed privately.
