[MNT] Tags using enums #2235

PR:
String values in _tags are replaced with corresponding Enum values.
Currently done only for Clustering module. Once approved will be escalated to other modules.
Algorithm types can be directly called via enum class, whereas for data structures and python dependencies
the value.Dependent modules are to be refractored in case direct enum is called. 
is called <explain precisely>. The changes have been applied to all the submodules (of clustering) consisitng

No new dependecy is introduced.
