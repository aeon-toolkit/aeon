# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member in our community and want to
ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable experience. Accordingly, those who
participate in the `aeon` project are expected to show respect and courtesy to other
community members at all times.

`aeon` uses the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct (CoC). You can find the [whole document
here](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

Everyone participating in activities associated with the `aeon` project (whether
in-person or remote) is required to conform to this Code of Conduct regardless
of platform.

## The Short Version

`aeon` and NumFOCUS are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
community members in any form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember
that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for
`aeon` or NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience, including people
of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## How to Report

If you feel that the Code of Conduct has been violated, feel free to Contact a member of
the `aeon` [Code of Conduct Moderators](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/about.html#code-of-conduct-moderators)
directly on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA)
or through the general `aeon` email ([contact@aeon-toolkit.org](mailto:contact@aeon-toolkit.org)).

OR

Submit a report directly to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working Group by using
[NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Reporting Form](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT?typeform-source=numfocus.org).

## Who Will Receive Your Report

If you have contacted the `aeon` Code of Conduct Moderators, the group will decide
whether to take action directly or forward it to the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working
Group. The workgroup may take immediate action if the situation requires it (e.g.
deleting a post, banning a user from a channel, etc.).

Using the NumFOCUS form, your report will be received and handled by NumFOCUS Code of
Conduct Working Group; trained, and experienced contributors with diverse backgrounds.
The group is making decisions independently of `aeon`, PyData, NumFOCUS or any other
organisation. You can learn more about the current NumFOCUS group members, as well as
the reporting procedure [here](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct).

## Actions Taken on Reports

Final decision-making on any report actions lies with the `aeon` Code of Conduct
Moderators. In most cases, however, the moderators will enforce the recommendations
made by the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working Group. If you are unhappy with a decision
made directly by the `aeon` Code of Conduct Moderators, you can contact the NumFOCUS
Code of Conduct Working Group directly through the reporting form.

Breaking the Code of Conduct may result in a range of actions, from a warning
to removal from `aeon` and its community spaces depending on the severity of the
action and prior history of violations.
