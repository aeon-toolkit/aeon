# Code of Conduct

You can find our full Code of Conduct (CoC) on our [website](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html).

The code of conduct aims to ensure a positive and respectful experience for all
members of the community. Community members should follow the principles set out in
the [Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

If you want to make a CoC report, contact the general `aeon` email
[contact@aeon-toolkit.org](mailto:contact@aeon-toolkit.org) or message a member of the
[Code of Conduct Workgroup (COCW)](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/governance.html#code-of-conduct-workgroup)
directly on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA).
