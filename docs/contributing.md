# Contributing to aeon

`aeon` is a community-driven project and contributions are most welcome. We value all
kinds of contributions, not just code. Improvements to docs, bug reports, and taking
on communications or code of conduct responsibilities are all examples of valuable
contributions beyond code which help make `aeon` a great package.

In the following we will give a brief overview of how to contribute to `aeon`. Making
contributions to open source projects takes a bit of proactivity and can be daunting at
first, but members of the community are here to help and answer questions. If you get
stuck, please don’t hesitate to talk with us or raise an issue.

Recommended steps for first time contributors, or to get started with regular
contributions:

1. Say hello in the `introductions` or `contributors` channel on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA)
and mention which places you are interested in contributing to.
2. Get setup for development, see the [developer install instructions](developer_guide/dev_installation.md)
for creating a fork of `aeon`.
3. Pick an enhancement, documentation or maintenance issue to complete i.e. improving
an algorithm, docstring or test. The [good first issue](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list may be a good place to start.
4. Create a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/compare)
with your changes from your fork. For help, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
or ask in Slack. Follow the PR template and checklist.
5. A core developer will review your PR and may provide feedback, which you can then
address. If you are unsure about any feedback, please ask for clarification.
6. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `aeon` repository. Thanks for
making a contribution! Make sure you are included in the [list of contributors](contributors.md).

Further guidance for contributing to `aeon` via GitHub can be found on the

reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA)
for discussion. While GitHub contributions are the most common, it is not the only
way to contribute to `aeon`.
