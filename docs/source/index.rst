Welcome to scikit-time
=================

* Framework for time series tasks such as forecasting and classification.
* Extends the scikit-learn interface, allowing for ease of use for familiar users.
* Efficient implementation of time series algorithms using numba.
* Interfaces with other time series packages to provide a single framework for algorithm comparison.
* Uses a system of optional dependencies to allow easy installation of basic functionality.
