# Welcome to aeon

- Framework for time series tasks such as forecasting and classification.
- Extends the scikit-learn interface, allowing for ease of use for familiar users.
- Efficient implementation of time series algorithms using numba.
- Interfaces with other time series packages to provide a single framework for algorithm comparison.
- Uses a system of optional dependencies to allow easy installation of basic functionality.
