# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member in our community and want to
ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable experience. Accordingly, those who
participate in the `aeon` project are expected to show respect and courtesy to other
community members at all times.

Everyone participating in activities associated with the `aeon` project (whether
in-person or remote) is required to conform to this Code of Conduct (CoC) regardless
of platform.

It is expected that community members will abide by the principles of the [Python
Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) to
help maintain an open, considerate and respectful environment.

Unacceptable behavior and code of conduct violations are determined and dealt with
at the discretion of the `aeon` [Code of Conduct Workgroup (COCW)](./governance.md#code-of-conduct-workgroup).
Possible actions taken include warnings, mediated meeting and/or apologies, and
expulsion from the project depending on the severity of the breach. The COCW can edit
and remove comments and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include (but are not limited to):
- Personal attacks, insults and threats
- Harassment of individuals or groups both publicly and privately
- Publishing private information of others, such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission
- The use of sexualised language or imagery in conversation or talks
- Jokes or insults based on stereotypes, slurs or other exclusionary language
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- General unethical and unprofessional conduct

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply
immediately.

If you believe someone is violating the CoC, we ask that you report it by
contacting the COCW. All reports will be kept confidential. You can make a report by
emailing the general `aeon` contact address [contact@aeon-toolkit.org](mailto:contact@aeon-toolkit.org),
or by messaging [members of the COCW](./about.md#code-of-conduct-workgroup)
directly on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aeon-toolkit/shared_invite/zt-22vwvut29-HDpCu~7VBUozyfL_8j3dLA).

Thank you for reading and helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for
everyone.
