# Getting Started

The following information is designed to get users up and running with `aeon` quickly.
If installation is required, please see our [installation guide](installation) for
installing `aeon`.

We assume basic familiarity with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
package. If you are confused, you may want to view
[their getting started guides](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html).

`aeon` is an open source toolkit for learning from time series. It provides access to
the very latest algorithms for time series machine learning, in addition to a range of
classical techniques for the following learning tasks:

- {term}`Forecasting` where the goal is to predict future values of a target time
series.
- {term}`Time series classification` where the time series data for a given instance
are used to predict a categorical target class.
- {term}`Time series extrinsic regression` where the time series data for a given
instance are used to predict a continuous target value.
- {term}`Time series clustering` where the goal is to discover groups consisting of
instances with similar time series.
- {term}`Time series annotation` which is focused on outlier detection, anomaly
detection, change point detection and segmentation.

Additionally, it provides numerous algorithms for {term}`time series transformation`,
altering time series into different representations and domains or processing
time series data into tabular data.

The following provides introductory examples for each of these modules. In the examples
used the datatypes most commonly used for the task, but a variety of input types for
data are available. See [here](/examples/datasets/AA_datatypes_and_datasets.ipynb) for
more information on input datatypes. For more information on the variety of estimators
available for each task, see the [API](api_reference) and [examples](examples) pages.

## Time Series Data

A time series is a series of real valued data assumed to be ordered. A univariate
time series is a singular series, where each observation is a single value. For example,
the heartbeat ECG reading from a single sensor or the number of passengers using an
airline per month would form a univariate series.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_airline
>>> y = load_airline()  # load an example univariate series with timestamps
>>> y.head()
Period
1960-08    606.0
1960-09    508.0
1960-10    461.0
1960-11    390.0
1960-12    432.0
Freq: M, Name: Number of airline passengers, dtype: float64
```

A multivariate time series is made up of multiple series, where each observation is a
vector of related recordings in the same time index. An examples would be a motion trace
of from a smartwatch with at least three dimensions (X,Y,Z co-ordinates), or multiple
financial statistics recorded over time. Single multivariate series input typically
follows the shape `(n_timepoints, n_channels)`.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_uschange
>>> y, X = load_uschange("Quarter")  # load an example multivariate series
>>> X.set_index(y).head()
         Consumption    Income  Production   Savings  Unemployment
Quarter
1970 Q1     0.615986  0.972261   -2.452700  4.810312           0.9
1970 Q2     0.460376  1.169085   -0.551525  7.287992           0.5
1970 Q3     0.876791  1.553271   -0.358708  7.289013           0.5
1970 Q4    -0.274245 -0.255272   -2.185455  0.985230           0.7
1971 Q1     1.897371  1.987154    1.909734  3.657771          -0.1
```

We commonly refer to the number of observations for a time series as `n_timepoints` or
`series_length`. If a series is multivariate, we refer to the dimensions as channels
(to avoid confusion with the dimensions of array) and in code use `n_channels`.
Dimensions may also be referred to as variables.

Different parts of `aeon` work with single series or collections of series. The
`forecasting` and `annotation` modules will commonly use single series input, while
`classification`, `regression` and `clustering` modules will use collections of time
series. Collections of time series may also be referred to a Panels. Collections of
time series will often be accompanied by an array of target variables.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_italy_power_demand
>>> X, y = load_italy_power_demand()  # load an example univariate collection
>>> X.shape
(1096, 1, 24)
>>> X[:5, :, :5]
[[[-0.71051757 -1.1833204  -1.3724416  -1.5930829  -1.4670021 ]]
 [[-0.99300935 -1.4267865  -1.5798843  -1.6054006  -1.6309169 ]]
 [[ 1.3190669   0.56977448  0.19512825 -0.08585642 -0.17951799]]
 [[-0.81244429 -1.1575534  -1.4163852  -1.5314215  -1.5026624 ]]
 [[-0.97284033 -1.3905178  -1.5367049  -1.6202404  -1.6202404 ]]]
>>> y[:5]
['1' '1' '2' '2' '1']
```

We use the terms case or instance when referring to a single time series
contained in a collection. The size of a collection of time series is referred to as
`n_cases` or `n_instances`. Collections of time typically follows the shape `
(n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)` if the series are equal length, but `n_timepoints`
may vary between cases.

The datatypes used by modules also differ to match the use case. Module focusing
on single series use cases will commonly use `pandas` `DataFrame` and `Series` objects
to store time series data as shown in the first two examples. Modules focusing on
collections on time series will commonly use `numpy` arrays or lists of arrays to
store time series data.

```{code-block} python
>>>from aeon.datasets import load_basic_motions, load_plaid, load_japanese_vowels
>>> X2, y2 = load_basic_motions()
>>> X2.shape
(80, 6, 100)
>>> X3, y3 = load_plaid()  # example unequal length univariate collection
>>> type(X3)
<class 'list'>
>>> len(X3)
1074
>>> X3[0].shape
(1, 500)
>>> X4, y4 = load_japanese_vowels()  # example unequal length mutlivariate collection
>>> len(X4)
640
>>> X4[0].shape
(12, 20)
```

## Forecasting

The possible use cases for forecasting are more complex than with the other modules.
Like `scikit-learn`, forecasters use a fit and predict model, but the arguments are
different. The simplest forecasting use case is when you have a single series and you
want to build a model on that series (e.g. ARMA model) to predict values in the
future. At their most basic, forecasters require a series to forecast for fit, and a
forecast horizon (`fh`) to specify how many time steps ahead to make a forecast in
predict. This code fits a [TrendForecaster](forecasting.trend.TrendForecaster) on our
loaded data and predicts the next value in the series.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_airline
>>> from aeon.forecasting.trend import TrendForecaster
>>> y = load_airline()
>>> forecaster = TrendForecaster()
>>> forecaster.fit(y)  # fit the forecaster
TrendForecaster()
>>> pred = forecaster.predict(fh=1)  # predict the next value
1961-01    472.944444
Freq: M, dtype: float64
```

An integer `fh` value will forecast *n* points into the future, i.e. a value of 3
will make a prediction for 1961-03. You can predict multiple points into the future by
passing a list of integers to `fh`.

```{code-block} python
>>> pred = forecaster.predict(fh=[1,2,3])  # predict the next 3 values
1961-01    472.944444
1961-02    475.601628
1961-03    478.258812
Freq: M, dtype: float64
```

You can split a series into train and test partitions. This code splits airline into
two parts, builds the forecasting model on the train portion and makes forecasts for
the time points represented in the test segment. In this example we use a
[ForecastingHorizon](forecasting.base.ForecastingHorizon) object to input our desired
forecast horizon using the Series index.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.forecasting.model_selection import temporal_train_test_split
>>> from aeon.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon
>>> from aeon.performance_metrics.forecasting import mean_absolute_percentage_error
>>> y_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)  # split the data into train and test series
>>> fh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)
>>> forecaster.fit(y_train)  # fit the forecaster on train series
>>> y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)  # predict the test series time stamps
>>> mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
0.11725953222644162
```

`aeon` has a rich functionality for forecasting, and supports a wide variety of use
cases. To find out more about forecasting in `aeon`, you can explore through the
extensive [user guide notebook](./examples/forecasting/forecasting.ipynb).

## Time Series Classification (TSC)

Classification generally use numpy arrays to store time series. We recommend storing
time series for classification in 3D numpy arrays even if each time series is
univariate. Classifiers will work with 2D input as you would expect from `scikit-learn`,
but other packages may treat 2D input as a single multivariate series. This is the case
for non-collection transformers, and you may find unexpected outputs if you input a 2D
array treating it as multiple time series.

Note we assume series length is always the same for all channels of a single series
regardless of input type. The target variable should be a `numpy` array of type `float`,
`int` or `str`.

The classification estimator interface should be familiar if you have worked with
`scikit-learn`. In this example we fit a [KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier](classification.distance_based.KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier)
with dynamic time warping (dtw) on our example data.

```{code-block} python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from aeon.classification.distance_based import KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier
``{code-block} python
>>> X = [[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]],  # 3D array example (univariate)
...      [[4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]]]  # Two samples, one channel, seven series length
>>> y = [0, 1]  # class labels for each sample
>>> X = np.array(X)
>>> y = np.array(y)
>>> clf = KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier(distance="dtw")
>>> clf.fit(X, y)  # fit the classifier on train data
KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier()
>>> X_test = np.array([[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]])
>>> y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)  # make class predictions on new data
[0 1]
```

Once the classifier has been fit using the training data and class labels, we can
predict the labels for new cases. Like `scikit-learn`, `predict_proba` methods are
available to predict class probabilities and a `score` method is present to
calculate accuracy on new data.

All `aeon` classifiers can be used with `scikit-learn` functionality for e.g.
model evaluation, parameter searching and pipelines. Explore the wide range of
algorithm types available in `aeon` in the [classification notebooks](examples.md#classification).

## Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER)

Time series extrinsic regression assumes that the target variable is continuous rather
than discrete, as for classification. The same input data considerations apply from the
classification section, and the modules function similarly.

The target variable should be a `numpy` array of type `float`.

"Time series regression" is a term commonly used in forecasting. To avoid confusion,
the term "time series extrinsic regression" is commonly used to refer to the traditional
machine learning regression task but for time series data.

In the following example we use a [KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor](regression.distance_based.KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor)
on an example time series extrinsic regression problem called [Covid3Month](https://zenodo.org/record/3902690).

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.regression.distance_based import KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_covid_3month
>>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
>>> X_train, y_train = load_covid_3month(split="train")
>>> X_test, y_test = load_covid_3month(split="test")
>>> reg = KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor(distance="dtw")
>>> reg.fit(X_train, y_train)  # fit the regressor on train data
KNeighborsTimeSeriesRegressor()
>>> y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)  # make label predictions on new data
>>> y_pred[:6]
[0.04218472 0.01459854 0.         0.0164468  0.06254257 0.11111111]
>>> mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
0.002921957478363366
```

## Time Series Clustering (TSCL)

Like classification and regression, time series clustering aims to follow the
`scikit-learn` interface where possible. The same input data format is used as the
modules. This example fits a [TimeSeriesKMeans](clustering.k_means.TimeSeriesKMeans)
clusterer on the [ArrowHead](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ArrowHead)
dataset.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.clustering.k_means import TimeSeriesKMeans
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_arrow_head
>>> from sklearn.metrics import rand_score
>>> X, y = load_arrow_head()
>>> kmeans = TimeSeriesKMeans(n_clusters=3, metric="dtw")
>>> kmeans.fit(X) # fit the clusterer
TimeSeriesKMeans(n_clusters=3)
>>> kmeans.labels_[0:10]  # cluster labels
[2 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0]
>>> rand_score(y, kmeans.labels_)
0.6377792823290453
```

After calling `fit`, the `labels_` attribute contains the cluster labels for
each time series. The `predict` method can be used to predict the cluster labels for
new data.

## Time Series Annotation

Annotation encompasses a range of time series tasks, including segmentation and anomaly
detection. The package is still in early development, so major changes are expected
as time goes on.

```{code-block} python
>>> from aeon.annotation.adapters import PyODAnnotator
>>> from aeon.datasets import load_airline
>>> from pyod.models.iforest import IForest
>>> y = load_airline()
>>> pyod_model = IForest()
>>> annotator = PyODAnnotator(pyod_model)
>>> annotator.fit(y)
>>> annotated_series = annotator.predict(y)
>>> annotated_series.head()
1949-01    1
1949-02    0
1949-03    0
1949-04    0
1949-05    0
Freq: M, dtype: int32
```
