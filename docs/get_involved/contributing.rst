How to contribute
=================



Welcome to aeon's contributing guide!

We value all kinds of contributions - not just code.
For a detailed overview of current and future work, check out our :ref:`roadmap`.

We are particularly motivated to support new contributors
and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills.

Recommended steps for first time contributors, or to get started with regular contributions:

1. Say hello (in the contributors channel on `Slack`_)!
2. Get set up for development, see `instructions in the developer guide <https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/stable/developer_guide.html>`_.
3. Pick a good first issue to work on from `this list <https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_
   suggestion: pick something small with simple content to learn the “process”
4. Feel free to attend the regular community meetings (see schedule on `Slack`_)
