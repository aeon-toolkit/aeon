## History

`aeon` was started in January 2023 as a fork of the `sktime` project by 8 core
developers using [v0.16.0](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/releases/tag/sktime-v0.16.0)
as a base. In the following years, the project has grown to include many more core
developers, had a complete revamp of governance structure, and relaunched numerous
modules for time series learning tasks. `aeon` was accepted as a NumFOCUS affiliated
project in December 2023.

## Artwork

High quality PNG, JPG and EPS logos are available are located in the
