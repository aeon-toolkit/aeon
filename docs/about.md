## History

aeon was started in January 2023 as a fork of the `sktime` project by 8 core developers.

## Funding

aeon is a community-driven project, however institutional and private grants help to assure its sustainability.

We would like to thank the following sponsors.

### Industry sponsorship

* Mercedes-Benz AG/Daimler AG donated 2500 EUR to support the maintenance and development of aeon in 2021, as part of their `FOSS program <https://opensource.mercedes-benz.com>`_.

### Research grants

`The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac.uk>`__ funded three months
of the initial development under the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund
(EPSRC grant no EP/T001569/1), particularly the `Tools, Practices and
Systems <https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/tools-practices-and-systems-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-scoping-workshop>`__
theme within that grant.

Markus Löning’s contributions between 2019 and 2021 were supported by:

* the `UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) <https://esrc.ukri.org>`_,
* the `Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) <https://www.cdrc.ac.uk>`_,
* the Enrichment Scheme at the `The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac.uk>`_,
* the JROST Rapid Response Fund, a community effort of `Invest in Open Infrastructure <https://investinopen.org>`_.

### Institutional sponsorship

The 2019 joint aeon MLJ development sprint was kindly hosted by `UCL <https://www.ucl.ac.uk>`_ and `The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac.uk>`_. Some participants could attend thanks to the initial funding of the `The Alan Turing Institute <https://turing.ac.uk>`_.

### Infrastructure

We would also like to thank `GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions>`__ and `ReadtheDocs <https://readthedocs.org>`__ for the free compute time on their servers.

### Internships

`Google Summer of Code (GSoC) <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com>`_, `Major League Hacking <https://mlh.io>`_ and `Outreachy <https://www.outreachy.org>`_ have all sponsored aeon internships.

The `Wellcome Trust <https://wellcome.org>`_ sponsored one aeon internship as part of Outreachy.
