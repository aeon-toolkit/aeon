description: "Ensure the project's Python virtual environment is activated for all terminal commands."
---

When running a terminal command for a Python project, first detect the operating system and shell.

- **If the shell is `fish`**: Use `source venv/bin/activate.fish` to activate the virtual environment.
- **Otherwise (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`)**: Use `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
- **On Windows**: Use `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.

Then, proceed with the requested terminal command. For example, to install dependencies, the command should be `pip install -r requirements.txt` only after the activation command has been run.
