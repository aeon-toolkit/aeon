    "For example, we might want to build a model that can predict whether a patient is sick based on their ECG reading, or a persons type of movement based on the trace of the position of their hand. This notebook gives a quick guide to TSC get you started using the TSC specific classifiers in this toolkit. If you can use scikit-learn, it should be easy.\n"
