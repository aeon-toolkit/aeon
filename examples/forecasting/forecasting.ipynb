    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the new, experimental, forecasting module in aeon. We have\n",
    "recently removed a lot of legacy code that was almost entirely wrappers around other\n",
    "projects, mostly statsmodels. Most of the contributors to aeon are from a computer\n",
    "science/machine learning background rather than stats and forecasting, and our\n",
    "objectives for forecasting have changed to reflect this. Our focus is on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. not attempting to be a comprehensive forecasting package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting is a wide field with lots of specific variants and use cases. The open\n",
    "source landscape is crowded with packages that focus primarily or exclusively on\n",
    "forecasting. We are not trying to do all things in forecasting. We want to focus on a\n",
    " few key use cases that reflect our research interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. fast forecasting with numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst our forecasters will work with data frames, our design principle is to write\n",
    "code optimised with numba and numpy. We found that extensive use of data frames in\n",
    "the internal calculations of forecasters makes them much slower and harder to\n",
    "understand for those not used to using dataframes daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. forecasting using machine learning and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "we want to implement and assess the latest machine learning and deep learning\n",
    "forecasting for scenarios where it makes sense to use them. Our initial experimental\n",

    " cleanest way to start.\n",

    " base class  `BaseSeriesEstimator` contains a method to validate and possibly convert\n",
    "  an input series.\n",
    "The `BaseForecaster` has three core methods: `fit`,  `predict` and `forecast`. It is\n",
