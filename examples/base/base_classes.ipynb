These methods are used when the estimators interact with other classes such as [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV), and is also used in aeon's `ComposableEstimatorMixin`, which we'll talk about later.\n",
