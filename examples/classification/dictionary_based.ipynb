    "# Dictionary based time series classification in aeon\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary based approaches adapt the bag of words model commonly used in signal processing, computer vision and audio processing for time series classification. Like shapelet based algorithms, dictionary approaches use phase-independent subsequences by sliding a window over time series. However, rather than to measure the distance to a subsequence, as in shapelets, each window is transformed into a word, and the frequency of occurrence of repeating patterns is recorded. Algorithms following the dictionary model build a classifier by:\n",
    "1. Extracting subseries, aka windows, from a time series:\n",
    "2. Transforming each window of real values into a discrete-valued word (a sequence of\n",
    "symbols over a fixed alphabet);\n",
    "3. Building a sparse feature vector of histograms of word counts; and\n",
    "3. Finally using a classification method from the machine learning repertoire on these feature vectors.\n",
    "The figure illustrates these steps from a raw time series to a dictionary model using overlapping windows.\n",

    "classification\"> [<i>&#x200B;</i>](./img/dictionary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary-based methods differ in the way they transform a window of real-valued\n",
    "measurements into discrete words (a process commonly called discretisation) in Step 2.\n",
    "Many methods are based on a representation called Symbolic Fourier Approximation\n",
    "(SFA). To create a discrete word from a window of continuous values in a series, SFA\n",
    "follows the following steps:\n",
    "1. Values in each window are normalized to have standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "2. The dimensionality of each normalized window is reduced by the use of the truncated\n",
    "Fourier transform: the window subseries is transformed using as fast Fourier transform,\n",
    "and only the first few coefficients are retained.\n",
    "3. Each coefficient is discretised into a symbol from an alphabet a fixed size to\n",
    "form a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating words from windows requires three parameters:\n",
    "1. 'window_size' specifies how long each window is;\n",
    "2. 'length' specifies the reduced series length used in reducing the length of the\n",
    "real valued window; and\n",
    "3. 'alphabet_size' is the number of letters in the alphabet used in the discretisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These core parameters are often fixed internally. There are currently four dictionary based classifiers implemented in aeon, all making use of the Symbolic Fourier Approximation (SFA) \\[1\\] transform to discretise into words. These are the Bag of SFA Symbols (BOSS) \\[2\\], the Contractable Bag of SFA Symbols (cBOSS) \\[3\\], Word Extraction for Time Series Classification  (WEASEL) \\[4\\] and the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) \\[5\\]. WEASEL has a multivariate extension called MUSE \\[7\\] and TDE has multivariate capability. We summarise their characteristics and give example usage in this notebook. More technical details are available in \\[8\\].\n",

    "\n",
    "BOSS is an ensemble of individual BOSS classifiers making use of the SFA transform. `IndividualBOSS` has arguments for `window_size` ($w$) default 10, `word_length` ($l$), default 8, and `alphabet_size` ($\\alpha$), default 4. Algorithms that use the `IndividualBOSS` classifier use ensembles that diversify their members through changing their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BOSSEnsemble` classifier is an ensemble of `IndividualBOSS` classifiers. It performs grid-search through a large number of combinations of `window_size` (default 10), `word_length` (default 8) and `alphabet_size`(boolean normalise each window) parameters. Of the classifiers searched only those within 92\\% accuracy of the best classifier are retained. Individual BOSS classifiers use a non-symmetric distance function, BOSS distance, in conjunction with a nearest neighbour classifier. BOSS internally tunes so there are few parameters to be altered. Generally it should be run using default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "cBOSS significantly speeds up BOSS with no significant difference in accuracy by improving how the ensemble is formed. cBOSS randomly selects a set parameters for $w$, $l$ and $\\alpha$, and keeps the best `max_ensemble_size` `IndividualBOSS` classifiers in the ensemble, where best means highest is estimated accuracy on the train data. The number of `IndividualBOSS` classifiers to keep in the ensemble and the number of randomly generated parameters to test are parameters `max_ensemble_size` (default 50) and `n_parameter_samples` (default 250). The `n_parameter_samples` parameter can be replaced with a maximum run time limit with the parameter `time_limit_in_minutes`. Setting this parameter will make the classifier randomly sample parameters for the specified amount of time. We call this capability contracting."
