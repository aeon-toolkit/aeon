    "# Convolution based time series classification in aeon\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a high level introduction to using and configuring convolution based\n",
    "classifiers in aeon. Convolution based classifiers are based on the ROCKET transform\n",
    "[1] and the subsequent extensions MiniROCKET [2] and MultiROCKET [3]. These\n",
    "transforms can be used in pipelines, but we provide two convolution based classifiers\n",
    " based on ROCKET for ease of use and reproducability. The RocketClassifier combines\n",
    " the transform with  a scikitlearn RidgeClassifierCV classifier.  Ther term\n",
    " convolution and kernel are  used interchangably in this notebook. A convolution is a\n",
    "  subseries that is used to create features for a time series. To do this, a\n",
    "  convolution is run along a series, and the dot product is calculated. The creates a\n",
    "   new series (often called an activation map or feature map) where large values\n",
    "   correspond to a close correlation to the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/convolution.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Windowing.\">\n",
    "\n",
    "ROCKET computes two features from the resulting feature maps: the maximum value\n",
    "(sometimes called a max pooling operation), and the proportion of positive values (or\n",
    " ppv). In the above example the first entry of the activation map is the result of a\n",
    " dot-product between $T_{1:3} * \\omega = T_{1:3} \\cdot \\omega = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3$. Max\n",
    " pooling extracts the maximum from the activation map as feature. The proportion of\n",
    " positive values (PPV) is $8 / 11$ in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of random convolutions are generated, and the two features are\n",
    "combined to produce a transformed train data set. This is used to train a linear\n",
    "classifier. [1] reccomend a RIDGE Regression Classifier using cross-validation to\n",
    "train the $L_2$-regularisation parameter $\\alpha$. A logistic regression classifier\n",
    "is suggested as a replacement for larger datasets.\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rocket2.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"ROCKET.\">\n",
    "\n",
    "ROCKET employs dilation. Dilation is a form of down sampling, in that it defines\n",
    "spaces between time points. Hence, a convolution with dilation $d$ is compared to\n",
    "time points $d$ steps apart when calculating the distance.\n"
