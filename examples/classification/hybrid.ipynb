    "The nature of the data and the problem dictate which category of algorithm is most appropriate. The most accurate algorithms on average, with no apriori knowledge of the best approach, combine multiple transformation types in a hybrid algorithm. We define a hybrid algorithm as one which by design encompasses or ensembles multiple of the discriminatory representations we have previously described. Some algorithms will naturally include multiple transformation characteristics, but are not classified as hybrid approaches. For example, many interval approaches extract unsupervised summary statistics from the intervals they select, but as the focus of the algorithm is on generating features from intervals we would not consider it a hybrid.\n"
