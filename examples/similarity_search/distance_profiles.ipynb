    "In the context of similarity search, where we have as input a time series $X = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_m\\}$ and a query $Q = \\{q_1, \\ldots, q_l\\}$, a distance profile is defined as a vector containing the similarity of $Q$ to every subsequence of size $l$ in $X$, with the $i^{th}$ subsequence denoted by $W_i = \\{x_i, \\ldots, x_{i+(l-1)}\\}$.\n",

    "### Trivial matches\n",
    "One should be careful of what is called \"trivial matches\" in this situation. If $Q$ is extracted from $X$, it is extremely likely that it will match with itself, as $dist(Q,Q)=0$. To avoid this, it is common to set the parts of the distance profile that are neighbors  to $Q$ to $\\infty$. This is the role of the `q_index` parameter in the similarity search `predict` methods. The `exclusion_factor` parameter is  used to define the neighbors of $Q$ that will also get $\\infty$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $Q$ was extracted at index $i$ in $X$ (i.e. $Q = \\{x_i, \\ldots, x_{i+(l-1)}\\}$), then all points in the interval `[i - l//exclusion_factor, i + l//exclusion_factor]` will the set to $\\infty$ in the distance profile to avoid a trivial match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same reasoning can also be applied for the best matches of $Q$. It is highly likely that the two best matches will be neighbours, as if $W_i$ and $W_{i+/-1}$ share $l-1$ values. The `apply_exclusion_to_result` boolean parameter in `predict` allows you to apply the exclusion zone defined by `[i - l//exclusion_factor, i + l//exclusion_factor]` to the output of the algorithm.\n"

    "The main idea behind optimizing the distance profile computation, in the case where we want to obtain the exact results (i.e. make no approximation), is to avoid recomputations as much as possible. For example, when computing the mean and standard deviation of each subsequence $W_1, \\ldots, W_{m-l+1}$, instead of computing these statistics independently for each subsequence $W_i$, we can exploit the fact that these subsequences are extracted from the same time series.\n",
