    "In the context of similarity search, where we have as input a time series $X = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_m\\}$ and a query $Q = \\{q_1, \\ldots, q_l\\}$, a distance profile is defined as a vector containing the similarity of $Q$ to every subsequence of size $l$ in $X$, with the $i^{th}$ subsequence denoted by $W_i = \\{x_i, \\ldots, x_{i+(l-1)}\\}$.\n",

    "Given a distance or dissimilarity function $dist$, such as the Euclidean distance, the distance profile $P(X,Q)$ is expressed as :\n",
    "$$P(X, Q) = \\{dist(W_1, Q), \\ldots, dist(W_{m-(l-1)}, Q)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then find the \"best match\" between $Q$ and $X$ by looking at the distance profile minimum value and extract the subsequence $W_{\\text{argmin} P(X,Q)}$ as the best match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trivial matches\n",
    "One should be careful of what is called \"trivial matches\" in this situation. If $Q$ is extracted from $X$, it is extremely likely that it will match with itself, as $dist(Q,Q)=0$. To avoid this, it is common to set the parts of the distance profile that are neighbors  to $Q$ to $\\infty$. This is the role of the `q_index` parameter in the similarity search `predict` methods. The `exclusion_factor` parameter is  used to define the neighbors of $Q$ that will also get $\\infty$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $Q$ was extracted at index $i$ in $X$ (i.e. $Q = \\{x_i, \\ldots, x_{i+(l-1)}\\}$), then all points in the interval `[i - l//exclusion_factor, i + l//exclusion_factor]` will the set to $\\infty$ in the distance profile to avoid a trivial match.\n"
