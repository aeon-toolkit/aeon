    "The `similarity_search` module in aeon provides estimators with a `fit`/`predict` interface for finding nearest neighbors in time series data. All estimators follow a standard interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fit(X)**: Takes a 3D collection of shape `(n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)`\n",
    "- **predict(X)**: Takes a 2D query series of shape `(n_channels, n_timepoints)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The module is organized by search type:\n",

    "- `subsequence` estimators find nearest neighbors among subsequences of time series\n",
