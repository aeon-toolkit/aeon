    "Time series clustering (TSCL) is a hugely popular research field that has engendered\n",
    "thousands of publications. The core problem is to group together\n",
    "Broadly, TSCL can be grouped into those that work with (possibly transformed) whole\n",
    "time series, and those that derive features that are not time dependent, and then use\n",
    " a standard clustering algorithm.\n",
