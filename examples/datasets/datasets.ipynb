    "Getting data into the correct data structure is fundamental. This notebook\n",
    "describes the datastructures used in `aeon` and links to more complex use cases.\n",
    "models two types of abstract data. Single series and collections of series.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single time series can be univariate (each observation is a single value) or\n",
    "multivariate (each observation is a vector). We say that the length of the vector\n",
    "(its dimension) is the number of channels, which in code we denote `n_channels`.\n",
    "The length of the series is called  the number of timepoints, or `n_timepoints` in\n",
    "code. We generally store a single series\n",
    "in a 2D numpy array with shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``. Series estimators\n",
    "should work with a univariate series stored as a 1D numpy array, but will internally convert to 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection consists of a group of time series, ideally assumed to be independent of\n",
    " each other. Each is also called a case or instance, and a collection contains a\n",
    " number of cases, denoted ``n_cases``. A  collection of equal length time series is\n",
    " internally stored in a 3D numpy array of shape ``(n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)\n",
    " ``. Collection estimators will work with a univariate collection of shape ``\n",
    " (n_cases, n_timepoints)`` which internally is converted to ``(n_cases, 1,\n",
    " n_timepoints)``.  Like ``scikit-learn``, we refer to a\n",
    " collection of cases as ``X``. Supervised learners (e.g. classifiers and regressors)\n",
    " require a target variable for training."
