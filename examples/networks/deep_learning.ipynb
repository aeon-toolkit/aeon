    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is proven to be very effective for Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks after the extensive experiments done in [1], especially Convolution based architectures i.e. FCN and ResNet [2]. A while later, InceptionTime (Convolution based) was proposed to become the new state-of-the-art deep learning model for TSC [3]. In [4], new hand-crafted convolution filters were proposed to boost InceptionTime. The model proposed in [4], Hybrid InceptionTime (H-InceptionTime) is currently, at the time of writing, the state-of-the-art deep learning model for TSC.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, in the latest Time Series Regression (TSER) review [5], the deep learning model InceptionTime is seen to be the state-of-the-art deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, deep learning models seem to work quite well to solve the Time Series Clustering task (TSCL).\n",
    "The models are from the deep learning clustering bake off [7] (more models from that bake off will soon be in aeon).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we cover the usage of the deep learning models for both TSC, TSCL and TSER.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon we plan to include more tasks into the deep learning domain suchas Time Series Forecasting."
