    "* the *machine implementation type* - or short: **mtype** - of a data container, which, for a defined *scitype*, specifies the python type and conventions on structure and value of the python in-memory object. For instance, a concrete (mathematical) time series is represented by a concrete `pandas.DataFrame` in `aeon`, subject to certain conventions on the `pandas.DataFrame`. Formally, these conventions form a specific mtype, i.e., a way to represent the (abstract) \"time series\" scitype.\n",

These are different mtypes which are admissible representations of the same scitype, \"time series\". Also, not all mtypes are equally rich in metadata - for instance, `pandas.DataFrame` can store column names, while this is not possible in `numpy.ndarray`.\n",
