description: "aeon-toolkit/aeon is a Python project focused on providing a comprehensive toolkit for conducting machine learning tasks with time series data. The project adheres to PEP8 and uses the Black code style for formatting. The documentation is built using Sphinx and MyST, and unit testing is done using pytest. The project also includes generalised tests for all machine learning algorithms, which are organized in a separate class."
