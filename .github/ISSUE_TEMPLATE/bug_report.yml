    description: |
      Please include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) so users can reproduce the error when running it. Be as succinct as possible, and do not depend on external data files.

      i.e. If you were reporting a bug about the `plot_series` function, changing the input name as an unintended side effect, you could include the following code:

      ```python
      from aeon.datasets import load_airline
      from `aeon.visualisation import plot_series

      y = load_airline()
      y = y.to_frame()
      y_name1 = y.index.name
      plot_series(y)
      y_name2 = y.index.name

      assert y_name1 == y_name2
      ```

      Being able to copy and paste code to reproduce an error is extremely helpful for us, and the issue will take longer to resolve if one is not included. If including a code example is not applicable for your report, enter "N/A" in the box.

      If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public [gist](https://gist.github.com) and link it in the issue.

      If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the full traceback of the exception. For instance the code example above raises the following exception:

      ```python-traceback
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "example_code.py", line 10, in <module>
          assert y_name1 == y_name2
      AssertionError
      ```

      ```python-traceback
      Place traceback error here if applicable. If your issue has no traceback, please describe the observed output without formatting.
