Thanks for contributing a pull request! Please ensure you have taken a look at our contribution guide: https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

Feel free to delete sections of this template if they do not apply to your PR, avoid submitting a blank template or empty sections.

#### Reference Issues/PRs

<!--
Example: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.

Please use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests you resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request is merged. See https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests
-->

#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

<!--
A clear and concise description of what you have implemented.
-->

#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?

<!--
If your contribution does add a dependency, we may suggest adding it as an optional/soft dependency to keep external dependencies of the core aeon package to a minimum.
-->

#### What should a reviewer concentrate their feedback on?

<!--
This section is particularly useful if you have a pull request that is still in development. You can guide the reviews to focus on the parts that are ready for their comments. We suggest using bullets (indicated by * or -) and filled checkboxes [x] here
-->

#### Did you add any tests for the change?

<!--
This section is useful if you have added a test in addition to the existing ones. This will ensure that further changes to these files won't introduce the same kind of bug. It is considered good practice to add tests with newly added code to enforce the fact that the code actually works. This will reduce the chance of introducing logical bugs.
-->

#### Any other comments?

<!--
Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering, convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.
