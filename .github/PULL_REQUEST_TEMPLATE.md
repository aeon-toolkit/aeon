#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

<!--
A clear and concise description of what you have implemented.
-->

#### Does your contribution introduce a new dependency? If yes, which one?

<!--
If your contribution does add a dependency, we may suggest adding it as an
optional/soft dependency to keep external dependencies of the core aeon package
to a minimum.
-->

#### Any other comments?

<!--
Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is
necessary; assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value all
user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to
review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either
case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.

##### For all contributions
- [ ] I've added myself to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/main/.all-contributorsrc). Alternatively, you can use the [@all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) bot to do this for you.
- [ ] The PR title starts with either [ENH], [MNT], [DOC], [BUG], [REF], [DEP] or [GOV] indicating whether the PR topic is related to enhancement, maintenance, documentation, bugs, refactoring, deprecation or governance.

##### For new estimators and functions
- [ ] I've added the estimator to the online [API documentation](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/en/latest/api_reference.html).

##### For developers with write access
- [ ] Optionally, I've updated aeon's [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to receive notifications about future changes to these files.
