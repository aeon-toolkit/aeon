"""Script for the GitHub issue self-assign bot.

It checks if a comment on an issue or PR includes the trigger
phrase (as defined) and a mentioned user.
If it does, it assigns the issue to the mentioned user.
Users without write access can only have up to 2 open issues assigned.
Users with write access (or admin) are exempt from this limit.
If a non-write user already has 2 or more open issues, the bot
comments on the issue with links to the currently assigned open issues.
