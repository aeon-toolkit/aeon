class BaseSegmenter(BaseSeriesEstimator, ABC):
    """Base class for segmentation algorithms.

    Segmenters take a single time series of length $m$ and returns a segmentation.
    Series can be univariate (single series) or multivariate, with $d$ dimensions.

    Input and internal data format
        Univariate series:
            Numpy array:
            shape `(m,)`, `(m, 1)` or `(1, m)`. if ``self`` has no multivariate
            capability, i.e.``self.get_tag(
            ""capability:multivariate") == False``, all are converted to 1D
            numpy `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has multivariate capability, converted to 2D numpy `(m,1)` or
            `(1, m)` depending on axis
            pandas DataFrame or Series:
            DataFrame single column shape `(m,1)`, `(1,m)` or Series shape `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has no multivariate capability, all converted to Series `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has multivariate capability, all converted to Pandas DataFrame
            shape `(m,1)`, `(1,m)` depending on axis

        Multivariate series:
            Numpy array, shape `(m,d)` or `(d,m)`.
            pandas DataFrame `(m,d)` or `(d,m)`

    Conversion and axis resolution for multivariate

        Conversion between numpy and pandas is handled by the base class. Sub classses
        can assume the data is in the correct format (determined by
        ``"X_inner_type"``, one of ``aeon.base._base_series.VALID_INNER_TYPES)`` and
        represented with the expected
        axis.

        Multivariate series are segmented along an axis determined by ``self.axis``.
        Axis plays two roles:

        1) the axis the segmenter expects the data to be in for its internal methods
        ``_fit`` and ``_predict``: 0 means each column is a time series, and the data is
        shaped `(m,d)`, axis equal to 1 means each row is a time series, sometimes
        called wide format, and the whole series is shape `(d,m)`. This should be set
        for a given child class through the BaseSegmenter constructor.

        2) The optional ``axis`` argument passed to the base class ``fit`` and
        ``predict`` methods. If the data ``axis`` is different to the ``axis``
        expected (i.e. value stored in ``self.axis``, then it is transposed in this
        base class if self has multivariate capability.

    Segmentation representation

        Given a time series of 10 points with two change points found in position 4
        and 8.

        The segmentation can be output in two forms:
        a) A list of change points.
            output example [4,8] for a series length 10 means three segments at
            positions (0,1,2,3), (4,5,6,7) and (8,9).
            This dense representation is the default behaviour, as it is the minimal
            representation. Indicated by tag "return_dense" being set to True. It is
            assumed to be sorted, and the first segment is assumed to start at
            position 0. Hence, the first change point must be greater than 0 and the
            last less than the series length. If the last value is
            ``series_length-1`` then the last point forms a single segment. An empty
            list indicates no change points.
        b) A list of integers of length m indicating the segment of each time point:
            output [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2] or output [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
            This sparse representation can be used to indicate shared segments
            indicating segment 1 is somehow the same (perhaps in generative process)
            as segment 3. Indicated by tag ``return_dense`` being set to False.

        Multivariate series are always segmented at the same points. If independent
        segmentation is required, fit a different segmenter to each channel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_segments : int, default = 2
        Number of segments to split the time series into. If None, then the number of
        segments needs to be found in fit.
    axis : int, default = 1
        Axis along which to segment if passed a multivariate series (2D input). If axis
        is 0, it is assumed each column is a time series and each row is a
        timepoint. i.e. the shape of the data is ``(n_timepoints,n_channels)``.
        ``axis == 1`` indicates the time series are in rows, i.e. the shape of the data
        is ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)`.
