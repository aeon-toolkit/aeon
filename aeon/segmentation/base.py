class BaseSegmenter(BaseEstimator, ABC):
    """Base class for segmentation algorithms.

    Segmenters take a single time series of length $m$ and returns a segmentation.
    Series can be univariate (single series) or multivariate, with $d$ dimensions.

    input and internal data format
        Univariate series:
            Numpy array:
            shape `(m,)`, `(m, 1)` or `(1, m)`. if ``self`` has no multivariate
            capability, i.e.``self.get_tag(
            ""capability:multivariate") == False``, all are converted to 1D
            numpy `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has multivariate capability, converted to 2D numpy `(m,1)` or
            `(1, m)` depending on axis
            pandas DataFrame or Series:
            DataFrame single column shape `(m,1)`, `(1,m)` or Series shape `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has no multivariate capability, all converted to Series `(m,)`
            if ``self`` has multivariate capability, all converted to Pandas DataFrame
            shape `(m,1)`, `(1,m)` depending on axis

    Multivariate series:
        Numpy array, shape `(m,d)` or `(d,m)`.
        pandas DataFrame `(m,d)` or `(d,m)`

    2. Conversion and axis resolution for multivariate

    Conversion between numpy and pandas is handled by the base class. Sub classses
    can assume the data is in the correct format (determined by
    ``"X_inner_type"``, one of ``VALID_INNER_TYPES)`` and represented with the expected
    axis.

    Multivariate series are segmented along an axis determined by ``self.axis``. Axis
    plays two roles:

    1) the axis the segmenter expects the data to be in for its internal methods
    ``_fit`` and ``_predict``: 0 means each column is a time series, and the data is
    shaped `(m,d)`, axis equal to 1 means each row is a time series, sometimes
    called wide format, and the whole series is shape `(d,m)`. This should be set for a
    given child class through the BaseSegmenter constructor.


    2) The optional ``axis`` argument passed to the base class ``fit`` and ``predict``
    methods. If the data ``axis`` is different to the ``axis`` expected (i.e. value
    stored in ``self.axis``, then it is transposed in this base class if self has
    multivariate capability.

    Segmentation representation

    Given a time series of 10 points with two change points found in position 4 and 8
    (lets index from 1 for clarity)

    The segmentation can be output in two forms:
    a) A list of change points: output example [4,8].
        This dense representation is the default behaviour, as it is the minimal
        representation. Indicated by tag "return_dense" being set to True.
    b) A list of integers of length m indicating the segment of each time point:
        output [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2] or output [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
        This sparse representation can be used to indicate shared segments (indicating
        segment 1 is somehow the same (perhaps in generative process) as segment 3.
        Indicated by tag "return_dense" being set to False.

    Multivariate series are always segmented at the same points. If independent
    segmentation is required, fit a different segmenter to each channel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_segments : int, default = 2
        Number of segments to split the time series into. If None, then the number of
        segments needs to be found in fit.
    axis : int, default = 1
        Axis along which to segment if passed a multivariate series (2D input). If axis
        is 0, it is assumed each column is a time series and each row is a
        timepoint. i.e. the shape of the data is ``(n_timepoints,n_channels)``.
        ``axis == 1`` indicates the time series are in rows, i.e. the shape of the data
        is ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)`.
