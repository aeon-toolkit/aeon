    The Time Warp Edit (TWE) distance is a distance measure for discrete time series
    matching with time 'elasticity'. In comparison to other distance measures, (e.g.
    DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) or LCS (Longest Common Subsequence Problem)), TWE is a
    metric. Its computational time complexity is O(n^2), but can be drastically reduced
    in some specific situation by using a corridor to reduce the search space. Its
    memory space complexity can be reduced to O(n). It was first proposed in [1].

        If callable then it has to be a distance factory or numba distance callable.
        If you want to pass custom kwargs to the distance at runtime, use a distance
        factory as it constructs the distance using the kwargs before distance
        computation.

    return_cost_matrix: bool, defaults = False
        Boolean that when true will also return the cost matrix.

        Arguments for metric. Refer to each metrics documentation for a list of

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the value of x or y provided is not a numpy array.
        If the value of x or y has more than 2 dimensions.
