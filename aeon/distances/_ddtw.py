    r"""Compute the DDTW distance between two time series.

    Derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) is an adaptation of DTW originally proposed
    in [1]_. DDTW takes a version of the first derivatives of the series
    prior to performing standard DTW. The derivative function, defined in [
    1]_, is:

    .. math::
        d_{i}(x) = \frac{{}(x_{i} - x_{i-1} + ((x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}/2)}{2}

    where :math:`x` is the original time series and :math:`d_x` is the derived time
    series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        First time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    y : np.ndarray
        Second time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    window : float, default=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.
    itakura_max_slope : float, default=None
        Maximum slope as a proportion of the number of time points used to create
        Itakura parallelogram on the bounding matrix. Must be between 0. and 1.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        ddtw distance between x and y.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x and y are not 1D or 2D arrays.
        If n_timepoints or m_timepoints are less than 2.
