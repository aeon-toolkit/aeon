def ddtw_distance(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, window: float = None) -> float:
    r"""Compute the ddtw distance between two time series.

    DDTW is an adaptation of DTW originally proposed in [1]_. DDTW attempts to
    improve on dtw by better account for the 'shape' of the time series.
    This is done by considering y axis data points as higher level features of 'shape'.
    To do this the first derivative of the sequence is taken, and then using this
    derived sequence a dtw computation is done.

    The default derivative used is:

    .. math::
        D_{x}[q] = \frac{{}(q_{i} - q_{i-1} + ((q_{i+1} - q_{i-1}/2)}{2}

    Where q is the original time series and d_q is the derived time series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray (n_channels, n_timepoints)
        First time series.
    y: np.ndarray (n_channels, n_timepoints)
        Second time series.
    window: float, default=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        ddtw distance between x and y.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from aeon.distances import ddtw_distance
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> y = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> ddtw_distance(x, y)
    0.0
