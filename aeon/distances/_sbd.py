    r"""
    Compute the shape-based distance (SBD) between two time series.

    Shape-based distance (SBD) [1]_ is a normalized version of
    cross-correlation (CC) that is shifting and scaling (if standardization
    is used) invariant.

    For two series, possibly of unequal length, :math:`\mathbf{x}=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,
    x_n\}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_1,y_2, \ldots,y_m\}`, SBD works by (optionally)
    first standardizing both time series using the z-score
    (:math:`x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}`), then computing the cross-correlation
    between x and y (:math:`CC(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})`), then deviding it by the
    geometric mean of both autocorrelations of the individual sequences to normalize
    it to :math:`[-1, 1]` (coefficient normalization), and finally detecting the
    position with the maximum normalized cross-correlation:

    .. math::
        SBD(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = 1 - max_w\left( \frac{
            CC_w(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})
        }{
            \sqrt{ (\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x}) * (\mathbf{y} \cdot \mathbf{y}) }
        }\right)

    This distance measure has values between 0 and 2; 0 is perfect similarity.

    The computation of the cross-correlation :math:`CC(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})` for
    all values of w requires :math:`O(m^2)` time, where m is the maximum time-series
    length. We can however use the convolution theorem to our advantage, and use the
    fast (inverse) fourier transform (FFT) to perform the computation of
    :math:`CC(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})` in :math:`O(m \cdot log(m))`:

    .. math::
        CC(x, y) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{
            \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}) * \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{y})
        \}

    For multivariate time series, SBD is computed independently for each channel and
    then averaged. Both time series must have the same number of channels!

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        First time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    y : np.ndarray
        Second time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    standardize : bool, default=True
        Apply z-score to both input time series for standardization before
        computing the distance. This makes SBD scaling invariant. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        SBD distance between x and y.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x and y are not 1D or 2D arrays.

    Compute the shape-based distance (SBD) between all pairs of time series.

    For multivariate time series, SBD is computed independently for each channel and
    then averaged. Both time series must have the same number of channels! This is not
    checked in code for performance reasons. If the number of channels is different,
    the minimum number of channels is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray or List of np.ndarray
        A collection of time series instances  of shape ``(n_cases, n_timepoints)``
        or ``(n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    y : np.ndarray or List of np.ndarray or None, default=None
        A single series or a collection of time series of shape ``(m_timepoints,)`` or
        ``(m_cases, m_timepoints)`` or ``(m_cases, m_channels, m_timepoints)``.
        If None, then the SBD is calculated between pairwise instances of x.
    standardize : bool, default=True
        Apply z-score to both input time series for standardization before
        computing the distance. This makes SBD scaling invariant. Default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray (n_cases, n_cases)
        SBD matrix between the instances of x (and y).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x is not 2D or 3D array when only passing x.
        If x and y are not 1D, 2D or 3D arrays when passing both x and y.
