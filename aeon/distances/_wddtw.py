    r"""Compute the wddtw distance between two time series.

    WDDTW was first proposed in [1]_ as an extension of DDTW. By adding a weight
    to the derivative it means the alignment isn't only considering the shape of the
    time series, but also the phase.

    Formally the derivative is calculated as:

    .. math::
        D_{x}[q] = \frac{{}(q_{i} - q_{i-1} + ((q_{i+1} - q_{i-1}/2)}{2}

    Therefore a weighted derivative can be calculated using D (the derivative) as:

    .. math::
        d_{w}(x_{i}, y_{j}) = ||w_{|i-j|}(D_{x_{i}} - D_{y_{j}})||

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray (n_channels, n_timepoints)
        First time series.
    y: np.ndarray (n_channels, n_timepoints)
        Second time series.
    window: float, defaults=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.
    g: float, defaults=0.05
        Constant that controls the level of penalisation for the points with larger
        phase difference. Default is 0.05.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        wddtw distance between x and y.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from aeon.distances import wddtw_distance
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> y = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> wddtw_distance(x, y)
    0.0
