    r"""Compute the DTW distance between two time series.

    DTW is the most widely researched and used elastic distance measure. It mitigates
    distortions in the time axis by realligning (warping) the series to best match
    each other. A good background into DTW can be found in [1]_. For two series,
    possibly of unequal length,
    :math:`\mathbf{x}=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}` and
    :math:`\mathbf{y}=\{y_1,y_2, \ldots,y_m\}` DTW first calculates
    :math:`M(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})`, the :math:`n \times m`
    pointwise distance matrix between series :math:`\mathbf{x}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}`,
    where :math:`M_{i,j}=   (x_i-y_j)^2`.

    A warping path

    .. math::
        P = <(e_1, f_1), (e_2, f_2), \ldots, (e_s, f_s)>

    is a set of pairs of indices that  define a traversal of matrix :math:`M`. A
    valid warping path must start at location :math:`(1,1)` and end at point :math:`(
    n,m)` and not backtrack, i.e. :math:`0 \leq e_{i+1}-e_{i} \leq 1` and :math:`0
    \leq f_{i+1}- f_i \leq 1` for all :math:`1< i < m`.

    The DTW distance between series is the path through :math:`M` that minimizes the
    total distance. The distance for any path :math:`P` of length :math:`s` is

    .. math::
        D_P(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}, M) =\sum_{i=1}^s M_{e_i,f_i}

    If :math:`\mathcal{P}` is the space of all possible paths, the DTW path :math:`P^*`
    is the path that has the minimum distance, hence the DTW distance between series is

    .. math::
        d_{dtw}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}) =D_{P*}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}, M).

    The optimal warping path :math:`P^*` can be found exactly through a dynamic
    programming formulation. This can be a time consuming operation, and it is common to
    put a restriction on the amount of warping allowed. This is implemented through
    the bounding_matrix structure, that supplies a mask for allowable warpings.
    The most common bounding strategies include the Sakoe-Chiba band [2]_. The width
    of the allowed warping is controlled through the ``window`` parameter
    which sets the maximum proportion of warping allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        First time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    y : np.ndarray
        Second time series, either univariate, shape ``(n_timepoints,)``, or
        multivariate, shape ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
    window : float or None, default=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used. window is a percentage deviation, so if ``window = 0.1`` then
        10% of the series length is the max warping allowed.
        is used.
    itakura_max_slope : float, default=None
        Maximum slope as a proportion of the number of time points used to create
        Itakura parallelogram on the bounding matrix. Must be between 0. and 1.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        DTW distance between x and y, minimum value 0.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x and y are not 1D or 2D arrays.

    By default, this takes a collection of :math:`n` time series :math:`X` and returns a
    matrix
    :math:`D` where :math:`D_{i,j}` is the DTW distance between the :math:`i^{th}`
    and the :math:`j^{th}` series in :math:`X`. If :math:`X` is 2 dimensional,
    it is assumed to be a collection of univariate series with shape ``(n_instances,
    n_timepoints)``. If it is 3 dimensional, it is assumed to be shape ``(n_instances,
    n_channels, n_timepoints)``.

    This function has an optional argument, :math:`y`, to allow calculation of the
    distance matrix between :math:`X` and one or more series stored in :math:`y`. If
    :math:`y` is 1 dimensional, we assume it is a single univariate series and the
    distance matrix returned is shape ``(n_instances,1)``. If it is 2D, we assume it
    is a collection of univariate series with shape ``(m_instances, m_timepoints)``
    and the distance ``(n_instances,m_instances)``. If it is 3 dimensional,
    it is assumed to be shape ``(m_instances, m_channels, m_timepoints)``.

        If None, then the dtw pairwise distance between the instances of X is
        calculated.
    window : float or None, default=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.
    itakura_max_slope : float, default=None
        Maximum slope as a proportion of the number of time points used to create
        Itakura parallelogram on the bounding matrix. Must be between 0. and 1.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        DTW pairwise matrix between the instances of X of shape
