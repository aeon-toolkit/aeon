r"""Dynamic time warping (dtw) between two time series.

DTW is the most widely researched and used elastic distance measure. It mitigates
distortions in the time axis by realligning (warping) the series to best match
each other. A good background into DTW can be found in [1]. For two series
:math:'\mathbf{a}=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m\}' and :math:'\mathbf{b}=\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,
b_m\}',  (assumed equal length for simplicity), DTW first calculates  :math:'M(
\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})', the :math:'m \times m'
pointwise distance matrix between series :math:'\mathbf{a}' and :math:'\mathbf{b}',
where :math:'M_{i,j}=   (a_i-b_j)^2'. A warping path
.. math::  P=<(e_1,f_1),(e_2,f_2),\ldots, (e_s,f_s)>
is a set of pairs of indices that  define a traversal of matrix :math:'M'. A
valid warping path must start at location :math:'(1,1)' and end at point :math:'(
m,m)' and not backtrack, i.e. :math:'0 \leq e_{i+1}-e_{i} \leq 1' and :math:'0
\leq f_{i+1}- f_i \leq 1' for all :math:'1< i < m'. The DTW distance between
series is the path through :math:'M' that minimizes the total distance. The
distance for any path :math:'P' of length :math:'s' is
.. math::  D_P(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}, M) =\sum_{i=1}^s M_{e_i,f_i}.
If :math:'\mathcal{P}' is the space of all possible paths, the DTW path :math:'P^*'
is the path that has the minimum distance, hence the DTW distance between series is
.. math::  d_{dtw}(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) =D_{P*}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}, M).
The optimal warping path $P^*$ can be found exactly through a dynamic programming
formulation. This can be a time consuming operation, and it is common to put a
restriction on the amount of warping allowed. This is implemented through
the bounding_matrix structure, that supplies a mask for allowable warpings.
The most common bounding strategies include the Sakoe-Chiba band [2].

    r"""Compute the dtw distance between two time series.

    Originally proposed in [1]_ DTW computes the distance between two time series by
    considering their alignments during the calculation. This is done by measuring
    the pointwise distance (normally using Euclidean) between all elements of the two
    time series and then using dynamic programming to find the warping path
    that minimises the total pointwise distance between realigned series.

    Mathematically dtw can be defined as:

    .. math::
        dtw(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{(i, j) \in \pi} \|x_{i} - y_{j}\|^2}

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray, of shape (n_channels, n_timepoints) or (n_timepoints,)
        First time series.
    y: np.ndarray, of shape (m_channels, m_timepoints) or (m_timepoints,)
        Second time series.
    window: float, default=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        dtw distance between x and y.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x and y are not 1D or 2D arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from aeon.distances import dtw_distance
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> y = np.array([[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]])
    >>> dtw_distance(x, y)
