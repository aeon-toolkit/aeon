    """Check a series being passed into pairwise is 3d.

    Pairwise assumes it has been passed two sets of series, if passed a single
    series this function reshapes.

    If given a 1d array the time series is reshaped to (1, 1, m). This is so when
    looped over x[i] = (1, m).

    If given a 2d array then the time series is reshaped to (d, 1, m). The dimensions
    are put to the start so the ts can be looped through correctly. When looped over
    the time series x[i] = (1, m).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray, 2d or 3d

    Returns
    -------
