r"""Edit real penalty (erp) distance between two time series.

ERP, first proposed in [1]_, attempts to align time series
by better considering how indexes are carried forward through the cost matrix.
Usually in the dtw cost matrix, if an alignment can't be found the previous value
is carried forward. Erp instead proposes the idea of gaps or sequences of points
that have no matches. These gaps are then punished based on their distance from 'g'.

    """Compute the ERP distance between two time series.

    ERP, first proposed in [1]_, attempts to align time series
    by better considering how indexes are carried forward through the cost matrix.
    Usually in the dtw cost matrix, if an alignment can't be found the previous value
    is carried forward. Erp instead proposes the idea of gaps or sequences of points
    that have no matches. These gaps are then punished based on their distance from 'g'.

    The optimal value of g is selected from the range [σ/5, σ], where σ is the
    standard deviation of the training data. When there is > 1 channel, g should
    be a np.ndarray where the nth value is the standard deviation of the nth
    channel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray, of shape (n_channels, n_timepoints) or (n_timepoints,)
        First time series.
    y: np.ndarray, of shape (m_channels, m_timepoints) or (m_timepoints,)
        Second time series.
    window: float, defaults=None
        The window to use for the bounding matrix. If None, no bounding matrix
        is used.
    g: float or np.ndarray of shape (n_channels), defaults=0.
        The reference value to penalise gaps. The default is 0. If it is an array
        then it must be the length of the number of channels in x and y. If a single
        value is provided then that value is used across each channel

    Returns
    -------
    float
        ERP distance between x and y.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If x and y are not 1D or 2D arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from aeon.distances import erp_distance
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
