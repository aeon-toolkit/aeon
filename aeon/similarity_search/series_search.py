class SeriesSearch(BaseSimilaritySearch):
    """
    Series search estimator.

    The series search estimator will return a set of matches for each subsequence of
    size L in a time series given during predict. The matching of each subsequence will
    be made against all subsequences of size L inside the time series given during fit,
    which will represent the search space.

    Depending on the ``k`` and/or ``threshold`` parameters, which condition what is
    considered a valid match during the search, the number of matches will vary. If ``k``
    is used, at most ``k`` matches (the ``k`` best) will be returned. If ``threshold`` is
    used and ``k`` is set to ``np.inf``, all candidates whose distance to the query is
    less than or equal to ``threshold`` will be returned. If both are used, the ``k`` best
    matches to the query with a distance less than ``threshold`` will be returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int, default=1
        The number of best matches to return during predict for each subsequence.
    threshold : float, default=np.inf
        The maximum allowable distance for a valid match.
    distance : str, default="euclidean"
        Name of the distance function to use. A list of valid strings can be found in
        the documentation for :func:`aeon.distances.get_distance_function`.
        If a callable is passed, it must either be a Python function or a Numba function
        with ``nopython=True`` that takes two 1D NumPy arrays as input and returns a float.
    distance_args : dict, default=None
        Optional keyword arguments for the distance function.
    normalise : bool, default=False
        Whether the distance function should be z-normalised.
    speed_up : str, default='fastest'
        Which speed-up technique to use for the selected distance
        function. By default, the fastest algorithm is used. A list of available
        algorithms for each distance can be obtained by calling the
        ``get_speedup_function_names`` function.
    inverse_distance : bool, default=False
        If ``True``, the matching will be based on the inverse of the distance, meaning
        the worst matches to the query will be returned instead of the best ones.
    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of parallel jobs to use.

    Attributes
    ----------
    X_ : np.ndarray, shape (n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)
        The input time series stored during the ``fit`` method. This is the
        database we search in when given a query.
    distance_profile_function : function
        The function used to compute the distance profile. This is determined
        during the ``fit`` method based on the ``distance`` and ``normalise``
        parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    For now, the multivariate case is only treated as independent.
    Distances are computed for each channel independently and then
    summed together.

        Predict method: Checks the shape of X and calls `_predict` to perform the search.

        If the distance profile function is normalized, it stores the mean and standard
        deviations from `X` and `X_`, where `X_` is the training data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray, shape (n_channels, series_length)
            Input time series used for the search.
        length : int
            The length parameter that will be used to extract queries from `X`.
        axis : int
            The time point axis of the input series if it is 2D. If ``axis == 0``, it is
            assumed each column is a time series and each row is a time point, i.e., the
            shape of the data is ``(n_timepoints, n_channels)``. If ``axis == 1``, the time
            series are in rows, i.e., the shape of the data is ``(n_channels, n_timepoints)``.
        X_index : int, optional
            An integer indicating whether `X` was extracted from the dataset given during
            the `fit` method. If so, this integer should be the sample ID.
            The search will define an exclusion zone for the queries extracted from `X`
            to avoid self-matching. If `None`, it is assumed that the query is not extracted
            from `X_`.
        exclusion_factor : float, default=2.0
            The factor used to define the exclusion zone relative to `query_length`. The
            exclusion zone is defined from
            ``id_timestamp - query_length // exclusion_factor`` to
            ``id_timestamp + query_length // exclusion_factor``.
            This also applies to the matching conditions defined by child classes.
            For example, in `TopKSimilaritySearch`, the `k` best matches are also subject
            to the exclusion zone, but with ``id_timestamp`` being the index of one of
            the `k` matches.
        apply_exclusion_to_result : bool, default=False
            Whether to apply the exclusion factor to the similarity search output.
            This ensures that two matches of the query from the same sample must be at
            least ``query_length // exclusion_factor`` apart.
            This prevents pathological matching cases where, for example, if we extract
            the top two matches, the second best match is likely to be located at
            ``id_timestamp Â± 1``, as they share all but one value.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the input `X` array is not 2D, an error is raised.
        ValueError
            If the length of the query is greater than `series_length`.

        This method calculates the matrix profile for a given time series dataset by

        time series. It handles exclusion zones to prevent nearby matches from being
        selected and supports normalization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray, shape (n_channels, series_length)
            Input time series used for the search.
        length : int
            The length parameter used to extract queries from `X`.
        axis : int
            The time point axis of the input series if it is 2D.
            - If ``axis == 0``, each column is a time series and each row is a time point,
              i.e., the shape of the data is ``(n_timepoints, n_channels)``.

            Boolean mask of the distance profiles, indicating where the distance
            should be computed. Initially, it is the mask for the first query of size
            `length` in `X`. This mask will be updated during the algorithm.
        exclusion_size : int, optional
            The size of the exclusion zone used to prevent returning consecutive
            top `k` candidates that are too close to each other (e.g., `i` and `i+1`).
            It defines a region between
            ``id_timestamp - exclusion_size`` and ``id_timestamp + exclusion_size``,
