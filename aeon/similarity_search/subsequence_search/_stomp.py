        Compute matrix profiles.

        The matrix profiles are computed on the collection given in fit. If ``X`` is
        not given, computes the matrix profile of each series in the collection. If it
        is given, only computes it for ``X``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray, shape = (n_channels, n_timepoints)
            A 2D array time series on which the matrix profile will be computed.
        k : int
            The number of best matches to return during predict for each subsequence.
        threshold : float
            The number of best matches to return during predict for each subsequence.
        inverse_distance : bool
            If True, the matching will be made on the inverse of the distance, and thus,
            the worst matches to the query will be returned instead of the best ones.
        exclusion_size : int

            the ones that are close to each other (for example i and i+1).
            It is used to define a region between

            :math:`id_timestamp + exclusion_size` which cannot be returned
            as best match if :math:`id_timestamp` was already selected. By default,
            the value None means that this is not used.
