def naive_distance_profile(X, q, mask, distance_function, distance_args=None):
    r"""
    Compute a distance profile in a brute force way.

    It computes the distance profiles between the input time series and the query using
    the specified distance. The search is made in a brute force way without any
    optimizations and can thus be slow.

    A distance profile between a (univariate) time series :math:`X_i = {x_1, ..., x_m}`
    and a query :math:`Q = {q_1, ..., q_m}` is defined as a vector of size :math:`m-(
    l-1)`, such as :math:`P(X_i, Q) = {d(C_1, Q), ..., d(C_m-(l-1), Q)}` with d the
    distance function, and :math:`C_j = {x_j, ..., x_{j+(l-1)}}` the j-th candidate
    subsequence of size :math:`l` in :math:`X_i`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array shape (n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints)
        The input samples.
    q : np.ndarray shape (n_channels, query_length)
        The query used for similarity search.
    mask : array, shape (n_instances, n_channels, n_timepoints - query_length + 1)
        Boolean mask of the shape of the distance profile indicating for which part
        of it the distance should be computed.
    distance_function : func
        A python function or a numba njit function used to compute the distance between
        two 1D vectors.
    distance_args : dict, default=None
        Dictionary containing keywords arguments to use for the distance_function

    Returns
    -------
    distance_profile : np.ndarray
        shape (n_cases, n_channels, n_timepoints - query_length + 1)
        The distance profile between q and the input time series X independently
        for each channel.
