        Uses information from previous decisions stored in state_info. This method
        should update state_info with any values necessary to make future decisions.
        It is recommended that the previous time stamp used for each case should be
        stored in the state_info. The number of rows in state_info after the method has
        been called should match the number of input rows.

        Default behaviour is to call _update_predict and set the predicted class
        probability to 1, other class probabilities to 0 if a positive decision is made.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : 3D np.array
