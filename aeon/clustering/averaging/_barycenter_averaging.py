    This implements an adapted version of 'petitjean' (original) DBA algorithm [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: np.ndarray, of shape (n_instances, n_channels, n_timepoints) or
            (n_instances, n_timepoints)
        A collection of time series instances to take the average from.
    distance: str or Callable, default='dtw'
        String defining the distance to use for averaging. Distance to
        compute similarity between time series. A list of valid strings for metrics
        can be found in the documentation form
        :func:`aeon.distances.get_distance_function`.
        If Callable provided must be of the form (x, y) -> (float, np.ndarray)
        where the first element is the distance and the second is the alignment path.
    max_iters: int, default=30
        Maximum number iterations for dba to update over.
    tol : float (default: 1e-5)
        Tolerance to use for early stopping: if the decrease in cost is lower
        than this value, the Expectation-Maximization procedure stops.
    precomputed_medoids_pairwise_distance: np.ndarray (of shape (len(X), len(X)),
                default=None
        Precomputed medoids pairwise.
    verbose: bool, default=False
        Boolean that controls the verbosity.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments to pass to the distance metric.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray of shape (n_channels, n_timepoints)
        Time series that is the average of the collection of instances provided.
