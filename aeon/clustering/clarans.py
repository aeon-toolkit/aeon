    """Time series CLARANS implementation.

    CLARA based raNdomised Search (CLARANS) [1] adapts the swap operation of PAM to
    use a more greedy approach. This is done by only performing the first swap which
    results in a reduction in total deviation before continuing evaluation. It limits
    the number of attempts known as max neighbours to randomly select and check if
    total deviation is reduced. This random selection gives CLARANS an advantage when
    handling large datasets by avoiding local minima.

    For a comparison of using CLARANS for time series compared to other k-medoids
    algorithms see [2].

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, default=8
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.
    init_algorithm : str, default='random'
        Method for initializing cluster centers. Any of the following are valid:
        ['kmedoids++', 'random', 'first'].
        Random is the default as it is very fast and it was found in [2] to
        perform about as well as the other methods.
        Kmedoids++ is a variant of kmeans++ [4] and is slower but often more
        accurate than random. It works by choosing centroids that are distant
        from one another. First is the fastest method and simply chooses the
        first k time series as centroids.
    distance : str or Callable, default='msm'
        Distance metric to compute similarity between time series. Any of the following
        are valid: ['dtw', 'euclidean', 'erp', 'edr', 'lcss', 'squared', 'ddtw', 'wdtw',
        'wddtw', 'msm', 'twe']
        If a callable is passed it must be a function that takes two 2d numpy arrays as
        input and returns a float.
    max_neighbours : int, default=None,
        The maximum number of neighbouring solutions that the algorithm will explore
        for each set of medoids. A neighbouring solution is obtained by replacing
        one of the medoids with a non-medoid and seeing if total cost reduces. If
        not specified max_neighbours is set to 1.25% of the total number of possible
        swaps (as suggested in the orginal paper).
    n_init : int, default=5
        Number of times the PAM algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final result will be the best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.
    random_state : int or np.random.RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization.
    distance_params : dict, default=None
        Dictionary containing kwargs for the distance metric being used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : np.ndarray, of shape (n_instances, n_channels, n_timepoints)
        A collection of time series instances that represent the cluster centers.
    labels_ : np.ndarray (1d array of shape (n_instance,))
        Labels that is the index each time series belongs to.
    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center, weighted by
        the sample weights if provided.
    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations run.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from aeon.clustering import TimeSeriesCLARANS
    >>> from aeon.datasets import load_basic_motions
    >>> # Load data
    >>> X_train, y_train = load_basic_motions(split="TRAIN")[0:10]
    >>> X_test, y_test = load_basic_motions(split="TEST")[0:10]
    >>> # Example of PAM clustering
    >>> km = TimeSeriesCLARANS(n_clusters=3, distance="dtw", random_state=1)
    >>> km.fit(X_train)
    TimeSeriesCLARANS(distance='dtw', n_clusters=3, random_state=1)
    >>> preds = km.predict(X_test)
