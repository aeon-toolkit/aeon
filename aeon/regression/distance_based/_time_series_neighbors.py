    An adapted K-Neighbors Regressor for time series data.

    This class is a KNN regressor which supports time series distance measures.
    It has hardcoded string references to numba based distances in aeon.distances,
    and can also be used with callables, or aeon (pairwise transformer) estimators.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, set k for knn (default =1)
    weights : string or callable function, optional. default = 'uniform'
        mechanism for weighting a vot
        one of: 'uniform', 'distance', or a callable function
    distance : str or callable, optional. default ='dtw'
        distance measure between time series
        if str, must be one of the following strings:
            'euclidean', 'squared', 'dtw', 'ddtw', 'wdtw', 'wddtw',
            'lcss', 'edr', 'erp', 'msm', 'twe'
        this will substitute a hard-coded distance metric from aeon.distances
        When mpdist is used, the subsequence length (parameter m) must be set
            Example: knn_mpdist = KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier(
                                metric='mpdist', metric_params={'m':30})
        if callable, must be of signature (X: np.ndarray, X2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
            output must be mxn array if X is array of m Series, X2 of n Series
    distance_params : dict, optional. default = None.
        dictionary for metric parameters , in case that distance is a str

    --------
