def custom_load_index(self):

    This is used to overwrite the numba internal logic to allow for caching during
    the cicd run. Numba traditionally checks the timestamp of the file and if it
    has changed it invalidates the cache. This is not ideal for the cicd run as
    the cache restore is always before the files (since it is cloned in) and
    thus the cache is always invalidated. This custom method ignores the timestamp
    element and instead just checks the file name. This isn't as fine grained as numba
    but it is better to invalidate more and make sure the right function has been
    compiled than try to be too clever and miss some.
