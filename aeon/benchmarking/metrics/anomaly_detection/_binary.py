    Range precision is the average precision of each predicted anomaly range. For each
    predicted continuous anomaly range the overlap size, position, and cardinality is
    considered. For more details, please refer to the paper [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : np.ndarray
        True binary labels of shape (n_instances,).
    y_pred : np.ndarray
        Anomaly scores for each point of the time series of shape (n_instances,).
    alpha : float
        Weight of the existence reward. Because precision by definition emphasizes on
        prediction quality, there is no need for an existence reward and this value
        should always be set to 0.
    cardinality : {'reciprocal', 'one', 'udf_gamma'}
        Cardinality type.
    bias : {'flat', 'front', 'middle', 'back'}
        Positional bias type.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Range-based precision

    Range recall is the average recall of each real anomaly range. For each real
    anomaly range the overlap size, position, and cardinality with predicted anomaly
    ranges are considered. In addition, an existence reward can be given that boosts
    the recall even if just a single point of the real anomaly is in the predicted
    ranges. For more details, please refer to the paper [1]_.

    ----------
    y_true : np.ndarray
        True binary labels of shape (n_instances,).
    y_pred : np.ndarray
        Anomaly scores for each point of the time series of shape (n_instances,).
    alpha : float
        Weight of the existence reward. If 0: no existence reward, if 1: only existence
        reward. The existence reward is given if the real anomaly range has overlap
        with even a single point of the predicted anomaly range.
    cardinality : {'reciprocal', 'one', 'udf_gamma'}

    bias : {'flat', 'front', 'middle', 'back'}

    implementation uses the community package `prts <https://pypi.org/project/prts/>`_
    as a soft-dependency.

    The F-beta score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, reaching
    its optimal value at 1 and its worst value at 0. This implementation uses the
    range-based precision and range-based recall as basis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : np.ndarray
        True binary labels of shape (n_instances,).
    y_pred : np.ndarray
        Anomaly scores for each point of the time series of shape (n_instances,).
    beta : float
        F-score beta determines the weight of recall in the combined score.
        beta < 1 lends more weight to precision, while beta > 1 favors recall.
    p_alpha : float
        Weight of the existence reward for the range-based precision. For most - when
        not all - cases, `p_alpha` should be set to 0.
    r_alpha : float
        Weight of the existence reward. If 0: no existence reward, if 1: only
        existence reward.
    cardinality : {'reciprocal', 'one', 'udf_gamma'}
        Cardinality type.
    p_bias : {'flat', 'front', 'middle', 'back'}
        Positional bias type.
    r_bias : {'flat', 'front', 'middle', 'back'}
        Positional bias type.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Range-based F-score
