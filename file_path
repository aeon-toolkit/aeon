Since the task involves removing commented out code and possibly refactoring it into active code, the contents of the new file will depend on the specific code that is commented out. However, the process will not involve writing new functions or classes, but rather cleaning up existing ones. Therefore, the new file will not contain any new functions or classes, but will be a cleaned-up version of the existing file.
